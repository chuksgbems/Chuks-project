calculator. cpp is a scientific calculator developed by me
This is a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations, as well as find the square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential of a number.

To use the calculator, simply run the program and follow the instructions on the screen. The program will prompt you to enter two numbers for addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential, you will only need to enter one number.

The program will then display the result of the calculation.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first step is to include the necessary header files. In this case, we need the `iostream` header file for input and output, and the `string` header file for strings.

2. Next, we define the functions that will perform the calculations. These functions are `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `squareRoot`, `cubeRoot`, `logarithm`, and `exponential`. Each function takes two numbers as input and returns a single number as output.

3. The `main` function is the program's entry point. It first prints the menu of the calculator. Then, it gets the user's choice of operation.

4. The `switch` statement performs the selected operation based on the user's choice. For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then prints the result of the calculation. For square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential, the program prompts the user to enter one number and then prints the result of the calculation.

5. The `return` statement at the end of the `main` function tells the operating system that the program has finished running.

I hope this helps!
