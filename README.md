calculator. cpp is a scientific calculator developed by me
This simple calculator program can perform basic arithmetic operations and find the square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential of a number.

To use the calculator, simply run the program and follow the instructions on the screen. The program will prompt you to enter two numbers for addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential, you will only need to enter one number.

The program will then display the result of the calculation.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first step is to include the necessary header files. In this case, we need the `iostream` header file for input and output, and the `string` header file for strings.

2. Next, we define the functions that will perform the calculations. These functions are `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `squareRoot`, `cubeRoot`, `logarithm`, and `exponential`. Each function takes two numbers as input and returns a single number as output.

3. The `main` function is the program's entry point. It first prints the menu of the calculator. Then, it gets the user's choice of operation.

4. The `switch` statement performs the selected operation based on the user's choice. For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then prints the result of the calculation. For square root, cube root, logarithm, and exponential, the program prompts the user to enter one number and then prints the result of the calculation.

5. The `return` statement at the end of the `main` function tells the operating system that the program has finished running.

I hope this helps!

randompass.Cpp is a random password generator created by me in C++
This README.md file explains how to use the randompass.cpp program to generate a random password.

## How to use the program

1. Compile the program by running the following command in a terminal window:

```
$ g++ randompass.cpp -o randompass
```

2. Run the program by running the following command in a terminal window:

```
$ ./randompass
```

The program will generate a random password and print it to the console.

## The program code
# Step-by-step explanation of the code

**The program code is divided into the following steps:

1. The random number generator is seeded with the current time.
2. The length of the password is defined.
3. The set of characters to choose from is defined.
4. The password is generated.
5. The password is printed to the console.**
